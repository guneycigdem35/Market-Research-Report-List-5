<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Ultrasonic Cutter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical ultrasonic cutter market is divided into two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact ultrasonic cutters use direct physical interaction with tissues, facilitating precise cutting and coagulation during surgical procedures. These are often favored for their accuracy and controlled penetration. Non-contact ultrasonic cutters, on the other hand, utilize ultrasonic waves without direct contact, minimizing tissue trauma and enhancing safety. Both types cater to different surgical needs, offering varied advantages in terms of precision, healing time, and procedural efficiency.</p></p>
