<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Citrus Bergamia Essential Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photosensitive Bergamot</li><li>Non-Photosensitive Bergamot</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Citrus Bergamia essential oil market is divided into two primary types: photosensitive and non-photosensitive bergamot. Photosensitive bergamot oil contains higher levels of bergapten, making it reactive to sunlight, potentially causing skin irritation when applied topically. This type is often used in fragrances and aromatherapy. Non-photosensitive bergamot, on the other hand, is treated to remove bergapten, making it safer for skin application and popular in cosmetics and skincare products. Both types cater to different consumer needs and preferences.</p></p>
