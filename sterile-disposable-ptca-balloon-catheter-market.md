<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sterile Disposable PTCA Balloon Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Compliant</li><li>Non Compliant</li><li>Compliant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Sterile Disposable PTCA Balloon Catheter market comprises three main types: semi-compliant, non-compliant, and compliant balloons. Semi-compliant balloons offer moderate expansion and adaptability to the vessel while providing controlled pressure during angioplasty. Non-compliant balloons maintain their shape and size under high pressure, ideal for delivering precise stents and treating calcified lesions. Compliant balloons gently expand to match the vessel's contours, ensuring even distribution of force. Each type serves distinct therapeutic needs in interventional cardiology, influencing clinical outcomes.</p></p>
