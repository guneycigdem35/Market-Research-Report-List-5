<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ingeo Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Spinning</li><li>Melt Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ingeo Fiber is produced using two primary spinning methods: solution spinning and melt spinning. Solution spinning involves dissolving polylactic acid (PLA) in a solvent and then extruding it through spinnerets to form fibers, resulting in a high-quality textile with excellent performance characteristics. In contrast, melt spinning involves melting PLA pellets and extruding them directly, allowing for a faster production process. Both methods cater to different applications in the textile industry, influencing fiber properties and market demand based on performance and sustainability needs.</p></p>
