<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Blower Motor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushed Motor</li><li>Brushless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive blower motor market includes two main types: brushed and brushless motors. Brushed motors use physical brushes to transfer electrical current to the rotor, offering simplicity and cost-effectiveness but with higher wear and maintenance. Brushless motors, on the other hand, use electronic controllers for current transfer, providing higher efficiency, durability, and lower maintenance. Brushless motors are increasingly favored in modern vehicles due to their energy efficiency and longer lifespan, while brushed motors remain prevalent in older or budget-friendly models.</p></p>
