<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Front Windscreen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The front windscreen market primarily features two types of glass: laminated and tempered. Laminated glass consists of two glass layers bonded with a plastic interlayer, offering superior safety by preventing shattering upon impact, making it ideal for windshields. Tempered glass, heat-treated for strength, shatters into small, blunt pieces upon breaking, commonly used for side and rear windows. Laminated glass dominates the front windscreen market due to its safety and durability, while tempered glass is preferred for other automotive applications.</p></p>
