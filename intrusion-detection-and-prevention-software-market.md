<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrusion Detection and Prevention Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IDS</li><li>IPS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Software (IDPS) encompasses two primary categories: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). IDS actively monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and alerts administrators of potential threats, serving primarily as a detection tool. In contrast, IPS not only detects intrusions but also takes automated actions to block or prevent identified threats, functioning as a protective barrier. The market for IDPS is driven by increasing cyber threats, regulatory compliance, and the need for robust cybersecurity solutions.</p></p>
