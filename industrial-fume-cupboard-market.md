<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Fume Cupboard Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Cupboard</li><li>Ducted Fume Cupboard</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial fume cupboard market comprises two primary types: ductless and ducted fume cupboards. Ductless fume cupboards utilize advanced filtration systems to clean and recirculate air back into the laboratory, making them ideal for facilities without extensive ductwork. In contrast, ducted fume cupboards expel hazardous fumes directly outside through a ventilation system, offering superior safety for handling volatile substances. Both types serve critical roles in ensuring a safe working environment by minimizing exposure to harmful chemicals.</p></p>
