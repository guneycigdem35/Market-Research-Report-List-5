<p><h1>Secondary Surveillance Radar Market Share & Market New Trends Analysis Report By Type, By Application, By End-use, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Secondary Surveillance Radar Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) is a type of air traffic control radar that enhances aircraft detection capabilities by employing transponders onboard the aircraft. Unlike primary radar, which relies on radio wave reflections to detect targets, SSR uses signals exchanged between the ground-based radar station and aircraft transponders. This system enables more accurate identification, altitude reporting, and enhanced situational awareness, crucial for modern air traffic management.</p><p>The Secondary Surveillance Radar Market is poised for significant growth, projected to expand at a CAGR of 8.1% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by increasing air traffic globally, the rising demand for advanced air traffic control systems, and the need for improved safety and efficiency in aviation operations. Additionally, technological advancements, such as the integration of SSR with satellite and ADS-B technologies, are enhancing the capabilities of radar systems. Furthermore, the expansion of commercial aviation and cargo transport is increasing the demand for SSR installations and upgrades. Emerging markets are also investing in modernizing their air traffic management infrastructure, bolstering market growth while addressing challenges such as congestion and operational efficiency in increasingly busy airspace.</p></p>
