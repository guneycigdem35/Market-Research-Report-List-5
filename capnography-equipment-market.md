<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capnography Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mainstream Capnographys</li><li>Sidestream Capnographys</li><li>Microstream Capnographys</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The capnography equipment market includes three main types: mainstream, sidestream, and microstream capnographs. Mainstream capnographs measure exhaled carbon dioxide directly at the airway, providing real-time monitoring, ideal for intubated patients. Sidestream capnographs sample exhaled gas through a tube, offering flexibility in various settings but may have slower response times. Microstream capnographs use a low-flow sampling method, allowing for accurate measurements with minimal invasiveness, making them suitable for emergency and intensive care applications. Each type serves specific clinical needs.</p></p>
