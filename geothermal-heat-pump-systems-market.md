<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Heat Pump Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Closed Loop</li><li>Horizontal Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal heat pump systems are classified into three main types based on their loop configurations. Vertical closed loop systems use deep underground wells, making them suitable for limited space. Horizontal closed loop systems are installed in larger areas, spreading pipes in trenches close to the surface. Open loop systems utilize groundwater directly, drawing it from a well before returning it, offering efficient heating and cooling but requiring sustainable water sources. Each type serves different site conditions and energy needs.</p></p>
